## Research Statement

My research focuses on the development of machine learning methods grounded in first principles, particularly in structured and scientific domains. I am interested in representation learning for systems governed by physical structure, where inductive biases, relational reasoning, and mathematical consistency play a central role.

I am especially motivated by problems where modern deep learning intersects with scientific computing — including molecular modeling, graph-based physical systems, and decision-making under structural constraints. My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of learning systems that are both theoretically principled and practically impactful.
